The field of ecology has experienced rapid growth since the discipline-specific journal, *Ecology*, was first published in 1920 [@reiners2017; @kim2018]. Today, with hundreds of ecology journals representing numerous subdisciplines, the field spans in scope from theoretical to applied and has become increasingly intertwined with the fields of natural history and conservation. In light of such growth and diversification, accomplishing a broad overview of the field can be challenging, and yet, a broad overview is critical for reasons including guiding new research, informing funding directions, and structuring educational frameworks [@mccallen2019].

The field of ecology has experienced rapid growth since the discipline-specific journal, *Ecology*, was first published over a century ago [@reiners2017; @kim2018]. 
<!-- The field as a whole arose in the late 19th or early 20th century drawing from a broad set of disciplines including geography, geology, evolutionary biology, systematics, physiology, natural history, and natural resource management [@simberloff1980; @egerton1983; @kingsland2005; @ayres2012; @huston2016]. -->
Today, hundreds of ecology journals represent subdisciplines spanning in scope from theoretical to applied and in scale from genomes to ecosystems.
In light of such rapid growth and diversification, synthesizing larger trends in a field can be challenging, yet broad overviews are critical for bridging subdisciplines [@staples2019; @margles2010], guiding new research, and informing funding directions and educational frameworks [@mccallen2019].

<!-- In any rapidly growing field of study, a potential danger is that researchers can become "siloed" in their own subdisciplines, thereby forming their own jargon and missing conceptual bridges or opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration [@staples2019; @margles2010].  -->
<!-- For example, some of the fastest growing subdisciplines in ecology fall under the umbrella of "applied ecology" with a focus on the conservation, protection, and management of natural resources, ecosystems, and plant and animal populations [@staples2019; @li2011; @lockwood2013; @griffiths2012]. -->
<!-- The proliferation of publication is likely owing to the mounting evidence of the scale and magnitude of the impact of human populations on global biogeochemical cycles, species extinction rates, and habitat conversion [@young2005; @li2011; @simberloff2010; @griffiths2012; @staples2019]. -->
<!-- This path is especially worrisome for applied ecological research because of the urgency for scientifically sound data to inform conservation and management decisions [@ipcc2014; @ipbes2019]. -->

The discipline of culturomics---the quantitative analysis of large bodies of text---offers a rich framework with which to track the evolution of a field through time [@michel2011; @ladle2016] and highlight areas of convergence across subdisciplines.
Specifically, word use in the published literature can serve as a proxy for tracking realized versus perceived importance of fundamental concepts and terms.
This approach has been successfully applied to smaller subsets of the ecological literature, notably a century of titles and abstracts in the journal *Ecology* [@kim2018], automated content analysis of titles and abstracts in top ecology journals based on impact factor [@mccallen2019], and more specific research questions restricted to certain regions or taxa [e.g., @beale2018, @Correia2018].

Here, we build on previous analyses [e.g., @carmel2013; @reiners2017; @courchamp2018; @kim2018; @mccallen2019] with the first full-text analysis of ecology journals over eight decades encompassing `r n_journals` journals, 131,533 articles, and over half a billion words.
We analyze the JSTOR full-text corpus from 1930 to 2010---the period of time with the most robust journal coverage in the JSTOR database---for all journals that regularly publish ecological or conservation papers and are not regionally or taxonomically exclusive.
We search the corpus for specific "n-grams," which are sequences of terms separated by a space.
For example, "biogeography" is a 1-gram and "body size" is a 2-gram (we herein denote n-gram terms in italics).
We standardize n-gram frequency by total words per year published across all included journals and analyze trends over time for a selection of n-grams.
We derive our n-gram selection through both algorithmic and hand-curated approaches: (1) drawing on the most frequent and rapidly growing/declining n-grams in various decades and (2) developing logical groupings of terms that fall under key ecology and conservation themes.

<!-- Our approach therefore enables data-derived comparisons of trends in ecology and conservation to yield insights into the evolution of key concepts, analytical techniques, and entire subdisciplines in these fields. -->

# Results

## Broad trends in popularity

Over the last eighty years, the most commonly used 1- and 2-grams in ecology generally shifted from fundamental- to more applied-ecology terms (Fig.
\@ref(fig:decades)a--d; Fig. \@ref(fig:declines-supp); Figs \@ref(fig:giant-1-1920) to \@ref(fig:giant-2-2000)).
Of the nine 1-grams that were most common in the 1940s, the top three remained the same in the 2000s: *species*, *plant*, and *area*.
However, the remaining most-common 1-grams in the 1940s (e.g., *time*, *water*, *number*) and all top-nine 2-grams from that era (e.g., *organic matter*, *soil moisture*) declined in use over time (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)a--b), whereas many of the most popular 2-grams in the 2000s barely appeared in the corpus until after 1970 (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)d).
By far, the 1- and 2-grams with the greatest rise in use over time were *climate* and *climate change* (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)d--f), as the ecological effects of climate change impacted study systems and overshadowed other drivers [@li2011; @scheffers2016; @staples2019] (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)e).
To that end, the 1- and 2-grams with the most rapid increases from 1980--2010 reflected a strong trend towards applied ecological research and other associated fields (e.g., *conservation*, *impact*, *biodiversity*, *ecosystem service*, *invasive species*; Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)e--f).

Changes in popular terms between the 1940s and 2000s reflected both shifts in science culture and changing societal needs.
In the 1940s, popular terms such as *time*, *number*, and *day* (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)a) referenced descriptive data.
Popular terms in the modern era representing related concepts included *data*, *effect*, and *model* (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)c).
This shift likely represented both a replacement of terminology and a transition from a largely descriptive discipline to a more quantitative one [@rios-saldana2018].
Popular terms in the 1940s included *blue grama* (*Bouteloua gracilis*) and *wheat grass* (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)b), which likely had greater significance during and after the Dust Browl drought of North American prairies in the 1930s [@mueller1942; @worster2004]. 
This focus on agricultural research---in an era that culminated in the formation of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [@yates1946]---was supported by other 2-grams from the 1940s, such as *organic matter*, *soil moisture*, and *fresh water* (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)b).
The decline in these historically popular terms may reflect trends in agricultural and soil scientists increasingly publishing in discipline-specific journals outside our corpus.

We examined trends in 2-gram terms associated with various scales in ecology (species, population, community, and ecosystem) by using a fill-in-the-blank algorithmic approach (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks) first two columns).
We found that *species richness* and *plant species* were the dominant adjective and noun uses of the term *species*, respectively (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)a--b).
The term *native* rose in popularity around 2000 to become the third most common term preceding *species* as of 2010 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)b).
This may correlate with the growth of studies within the field of invasion biology---a subdiscipline that explicitly distinguishes between native and nonnative species---which also saw a rise in publications from the late 1990s onward [@simberloff2010].
As an adjective, the term *population* was primarily associated with *size*, *growth*, *dynamics*, and *density*, with *population growth* following approximately exponential growth itself (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)d).
Conversely, *natural population* was the dominant noun form of *population*, but was surpassed by *human population* as of 2010 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)e).
Ecologists wrote about *community structure* and *community composition* more than any other adjective form of *community* and about *plant communities*, within our corpus, over `r plants_next_biggest` times more often than any other form of community (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)g--h).
The term *ecosystem* existed as a noun long before it was used as an adjective starting around 1970 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)j--k).
<!-- The increasing use of *ecosystem* as an adjective may reflect the ecological communities' acceptance of Odum's advocation that that *ecosystems* were a fundamental component in ecology, akin to *populations* and *communities* [@odum1953; @willis1997].  -->
As a noun, *ecosystem* was most commonly associated with *forest*, *terrestrial*, and *marine*, with the latter seeing a sharp uptick after 2000 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)k).
As an adjective, *ecosystem service* and *ecosystem function* were the dominant 2-grams (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)j), the former showing a rapid increase shortly after the United Nations' Milleneum Ecosystem Assessment championed the concept as a fundamental principle [@mea2005].

Using the same fill-in-the-blank approach, we examined adjectives associated with conservation, diversity, experiment, and analysis (Fig.
\@ref(fig:blanks) third column).
*Biodiversity conservation* did not appear until the mid 1980s in our corpus
(the term *biodiversity* was not coined until 1985 [@wilson1988] (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)e) but was used over twice as often as the next most common conservation term, *nature conservation*, by 2010 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)c).
*Genetic diversity* rose quickly in the early 1990s to become the dominant adjective associated with diversity (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)f).
References to *field* and *laboratory experiment* peaked around 1990 and declined thereafter (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)i).
*Statistical*, the only top adjective associated with *analysis* that appeared in the corpus in the 1930s, continued to see growth as of 2010 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)l); however, *data analysis*, which did not appear until 1950, surpassed *statistical analysis* around 2000 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)l).
*Meta-analysis*, which first appeared in the late 1980s in our corpus, saw rapid growth to become the most common adjective associated with analysis as of 2010 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)l).

## Conservation and applied ecology

Terms and phrases related to *conservation* and applied ecology represented some of the fastest growing n-grams in modern ecology (Fig.
\@ref(fig:decades)e).
*Conservation* as a field originated alongside the formation of the Society for Conservation Biology in 1985 [@meine2006], prior to which the term *preservation* was used as frequently in ecological literature (Fig.
\@ref(fig:cons)a, Fig.
\@ref(fig:conservation-all)).
<!-- TODO: this needs clarification and references: Though *preservation* and *conservation* may seem roughly synonymous in retrospect, these concepts originated in western environmental thought as opposites[REF], and the rise of conservation reflects a distinct shift in the land ethic and desirable outcomes of ecological management[REF?].
-->
Alongside *conservation*, *biodiversity* was one of the most quickly growing terms we analyzed in the corpus (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)e).
*Biodiversity*, a core concept of conservation, replaced the phrase *biological diversity*, which had been in use since the 1960s [@soule1980].
Given the prominent focus on biodiversity conservation in the field of ecology, ecologists increasingly studied the major threats to biodiversity loss: *habitat loss*, *invasive species*, *pollution*, *overpopulation*, *overexploitation*, and *climate change* (Fig.
\@ref(fig:cons)b).
Despite *overexploitation* being considered one of the most prevalent causes of species extinctions worldwide [@maxwell2016; @ipbes2019], the term itself received relatively little attention in our corpus (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)b), though frequencies of terms associated with specific modes of exploitation, such as *hunting*, *fishing*, and *logging*, all grew steadily (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)e).
Up until the early 1990s, *pollution* was the leading term in the context of threats to biodiversity and its use peaked in the ecological literature in the mid-1970s (Fig.
\@ref(fig:cons)b).
Frequencies of the term *ozone*, typically associated with studies of pollution, displayed a similar trend as *pollution*, but with a lag of approximately 15 years (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)c) and peaked in frequency around 1985 with the announcement of an ozone hole over the Antarctic continent [@farman1985].
The term *pollution* was then surpassed by *climate change* and subsequently by *invasive species*, two terms that as of 2010 vastly outweighed all other threats in their frequency of use (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)b) and two of the top three fastest growing terms in all of ecology (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)f).

A multitude of concepts originated alongside the proliferation of studies of climate change, habitat loss, and overexploitation (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)c-e).
For example, terms related to climate change, such as *ocean acidification*, *range shifts*, and *climate extremes* saw sharp upticks after the mid 2000s (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)c).
Other concepts showed more complex patterns.
For example, *sea-level rise* showed a spike in frequency in the mid 1990s, a downturn in frequency by 2000, and then another increase thereafter (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)c).
*Fragmentation* rose sharply following the common use of the related term *habitat loss* around 1990, but its use was in decline after about 2000 (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)d).
Interestingly, *fragmentation* and the commonly associated concept *theory of island* biogeography showed similar patterns of use, with *fragmentation* lagging by approximately two decades (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)d).
In terms of modes of species exploitation and resource extraction, *fishing* was the leading term in our corpus as of 2010, followed by *hunting* and *logging* (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)e).
Historically, *hunting* and *fishing* exchanged positions of dominance in our corpus every decade, showing predator-prey-like dynamics in their frequency over time (Fig.
\@ref(fig:cons)e). 
Modes of exploitation of non-animal resources, such as *logging*, *harvesting*, and *mining*, were consistently discussed less in our corpus compared to modes of animal exploitation (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)e).
<!-- Despite such relatively recent concept formations, such concepts have been the focus of multiple recent literature reviews [@scheffers2016; @pecl2017] and their associated terms are experiencing continued growth.  -->

The prevention of biodiversity loss is a key goal of conservation ecologists, and the concept of protection has long been a pillar of biodiversity conservation [@watson2014]. Until roughly 2000, *park* was the most frequently used term related to forms of geographic protection (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)f).
References to *protected areas*  rose steadily since 1930 with the growth in *marine protected areas* showing a related pattern, but lagging by several decades (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)f). 
These patterns of usage approximately mirrored the growth rate of actual protected land and sea area globally [@watson2014].
Many of the key forms of geographic protection, including *parks*, *reserves*, *protected areas*, and *preserves* predated the frequent usage of the term *conservation* (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)a,f), although this could be due in part to several of these terms also acting as verbs.
<!-- Nevertheless, the clear and sustained rise in all terms related to geographic protection over eight decades points to their continued importance in conservation and applied ecology. -->

## Ecological scale and community ecology

<!-- TODO: add a bit about the hypothesis and theory panels being data-driven -->

From the onset, ecologists and conservation biologists studied organisms at the species-level, reflected by the frequent mentions and sustained growth of *species* in the corpus over time (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)a, Fig. \@ref(fig:community-all)).
Though references to the *cell*ular level were initially the next most common, interest within the field of ecology then transitioned to *populations*, followed by *communities* and *ecosystems* (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)b).
It is perhaps unsurprising that *ecosystem* was the least common term given that it is also the youngest scale: while the term *ecosystem* was first described in 1935 by Tansley [@tansley1935], ecosystem ecology was not formalized until 1953 by Odum [@odum1953].
Furthermore, as ecosystem ecology extends into biogeochemistry, our corpus likely missed many relevant ecosystem journals.

Population and community ecology are worth further consideration as they represent the next two most common ecological scales following species.
While *population* was a more common 1-gram than *community*, the terms may be linked considering that many community ecology papers include the study of *populations*.
The way we study populations and communities appears to have changed over time.
Mathematical Lotka-Volterra models emerged in the 1920s to examine competition and predator-prey dynamics, and *competition* and *predation* were the interactions most commonly included in the corpus (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)c) corresponding with calls from ecologists to consider the importance of *facilitation* and *mutualism* in ecological theories [@bruno2003; @brooker2008]. 
<!-- SA: Not entirely sure about the logic of this previous sentence -->
Yet, both *competition* and *predation* experienced steep declines since the 1980s and early 2000s, respectively (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)c).
The declines perhaps reflect that Lotka-Volterra models, while overly simple, marked the beginning of mathematical ecology that has now moved beyond one or two species to explain more complex community dynamics, such as food web structure and ecological niche modeling (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks-supp)).

The most commonly represented theories of community ecology, which were posed to explain community structure and diversity patterns, all appeared to decline from peak levels (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)f).
For example, the theory of the *climax community* climaxed in the 1940s [@clements1936], followed by a peak for the *theory of island* biogeography in the late 1970s [@macarthur1967], and a peak and dropoff in *neutral theory* in the mid-2000s [@hubbell2001] (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)f).
We also saw changing patterns around the hypotheses predicting biodiversity.
Specifically, one of the earliest hypotheses stemming from Darwin's finches is the *competition hypothesis*, which peaked in the 1980s and was replaced by the intermediate *disturbance hypothesis* [@connell1978] (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)e).
Yet, the intermediate *disturbance hypothesis* peaked itself in the 2000s, perhaps explained by later critiques [@fox2013] (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)e).
Population and community ecologists may now favour asking what drives biodiversity. Indeed, metrics of *diversity*, which incorporates both *abundance* and *richness*, have steadily increased since 1990 (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)d).
<!-- SK: Although the term *niche* reamins a fundamental concept in community ecology (@Reiners2017), we never identified it as a top ??144??? 1-grams for any given time period (ADD "DECADAL GIANT" FIG CITE HERE). Despite this, we used the same fill-in-the-blank algorithms, we found the terms *niche breadth* and *niche width* were the most frequently used in the 1970's and 1980s, being replaced by the terms *niche model* and *niche conservatism* as the most frequent today (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks-supp)c--d). We find that the term *ecological niche* has rapidly increased in frequency as the most frequent descriptor of *niche* (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks-supp)d). -->

<!-- TODO: cite and describe Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks-supp) perhaps more than what I added above; also make sure to describe the niche panels (c--d) [SK - (1) added in text in niche panels Fig. S2, but if we're not including the panels in the main text does it make sense to include discussion of them? (2) I wasn't sure what you need for "Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks-supp), but I changed the text a bit to something a little clearer? don't know if that works..."-->

<!-- TODO: From SK - I looked through the new "Decadal giant" 1 grams and "niche" never came up as a top -->

## Statistics, data analysis, and genetics

Ecology increasingly became a data- and model-centric discipline (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades), Fig. \@ref(fig:methods), Fig. \@ref(fig:methods-all)) over the eight-decade time period. *Regression*, an overarching term encompassing many statistical approaches, saw continued and rapid growth in use since the 1950s, approaching *correlation* by 2005 (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)a).
References to *ANOVA* and *t-tests* both peaked around 2000, while mentions of generalized linear models (*GLMs*) steadily increased in frequency, surpassing *t-tests* in `r glm_surpasses_ttest` (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)a).
In terms of how such models were fit, *least-squares*, formerly the dominant paradigm, was rapidly surpassed by *Bayesian*, *maximum likelihood*, and *information theoretic* terms around 2000; as of 2010, the term *Bayesian* was used over twice as often as *maximum likelihood* (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)b).
The Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method (*MCMC*) first appears in the corpus in `r mcmc_first_year` [@thompson1994], `r mcmc_first_year - 1970` years after Hastings[@hastings1970] described the concept.
Combined with modern computing power, MCMC has been responsible for much of the boom in applied Bayesian data analysis [@gelman2014b].

Such statistical approaches and paradigms have been associated with endless debates about the role of hypothesis testing in ecology [@quinn1983; @burnham2002; @johnson2004].
To that end, use of the phrase *null hypothesis* peaked in the 1980s and the phrase *significant difference* peaked around 1990 and declined thereafter (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)c).
The associated terms *p-value* and *confidence interval* appeared in approximately equal frequency as of 2010 (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)c), although both are often referred to by abbreviations missed in our corpus (e.g. "p =" or "CI").
*Power analysis* remained a rarely used term as of 2010 despite numerous calls for its increased use [@nakagawa2007; @smith2011d].
The increased frequency of so many data- and model-centric terms, along with the advent of online publishing, coincided with the meteoric rise of *supplementary material* n-grams since around 2000---the 2-gram itself had the second most rapid increase across all 2-grams from 2000--2010 (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)f)---and a concomitant decline in *unpublished data* and *personal communication* [@federer2018] (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)d, Fig. \@ref(fig:methods-all)).

The focus on genetics in ecology and conversation-related research increased markedly in the last several decades (*genetic diversity* in Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)f, Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)e,f, Fig. \@ref(fig:methods-all)).
*Phylogenetics* remained the most commonly referenced genetic term from 1930 to 2010, and increased in use rapidly after the later 1980s (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)e).
In terms of genetic tools, *microsatellites* and *mtDNA* were the most commonly referenced terms as of 2010.
With the development of *next-generation sequencing* [@sanger1977], we also saw an increase in sequencing-based approaches to studying genetic diversity, particularly the rise in references to *single nucleotide polymorphisms* (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)f).
Since 2010, there has likely been a continued increase in references to *next-generation sequencing* given that it is now widely adopted in ecological research of many species---not just model species [@andrews2016].

<!-- TODO: add paragraph about different genetic tools and potential ongoing evolution of genetic fields (one of we perhaps missed and stopping in 2010?) -->

## Social sciences

Over the last few decades, ecologists paid increasing attention to the human dimensions of ecology and biodiversity conservation [@bennett2017] (Fig.
\@ref(fig:social), Fig. \@ref(fig:social-all)).
Since the 1990s, references to market or *community-based management* interventions gained traction---particularly environmental certification programs and payment for ecosystem services schemes such as the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (*REDD*) program (Fig. \@ref(fig:social)a).
We also observed an increased focus on *human well-being* (Fig. \@ref(fig:social)b), with a spike of references to *human health* in the 1970s and, more recently, an overall growth in references to *poverty*, *food security*, and overall *human well-being* since the 1990s.
This trend is parallelled by the rise in frequency of the terms *ecosystem service* and *ecosystem function* (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)j), which are two terms that explicitly focus on ecological processes in terms of their benefits to humans.
Given the increased focus on the human dimensions of biodiversity conservation over the last decades [@bennett2017], it makes sense that social science methods such as *interviews* and *questionnaires* would become more widely noted in the literature (Fig. \@ref(fig:social)c).
Ecology is just starting to acknowledge different ways of knowing; however, qualitative methods such as *focus groups*, *ethnography*, or *participant observation* remained scarcely referenced, which supports the assertion that ecology and conservation continued to rely mostly on quantitative approaches [@moon2016] (Fig. \@ref(fig:social)c).
Parallel to the increased focus on human well-being since the 1970s, we observed an increased frequency of n-grams related to *stakeholders*, *local communities*, and *indigenous people* (Fig. \@ref(fig:social)d).
Yet, it is clear that key stakeholder groups such as indigenous people are still underrepresented if we take into account how much land is under indigenous management [@garnett2018].

# Discussion

The ecological lexicon has expanded and evolved over the last 80 years.
The most frequently used terms in the 1930s were derived from the breadth of disciplines that inspired early ecologists [@simberloff1980; @egerton1983; @kingsland2005; @ayres2012; @huston2016], and by the 2000s, many were replaced by terms that reflected the emergence of a data-driven scientific field largely focused on applied environmental problems.
The turnover in ecological terminology demonstrates how ecologists have embraced many newly coined terms such as *biodiversity*, *climate change*, and *meta analysis* that did not exist in the early-decades of the field, and signifies the evolution of ecology into a fully independent field of study.
Our results, based on the first-ever full-text analysis of multiple ecology and conservation journals, reinforce the notion of both previous quantitative- [@kim2018; @mccallen2019] and expert-opinion-based studies [@reiners2017] that ecologists are working on increasingly complex and specialized topics, at broader spatial scales [@estes2018], and at higher levels of taxonomic and hierarchical organization [@kim2018].

There has been a notable shift in ecologists' descriptions of analytical techniques, demonstrating the evolution of ecological research into a more quantitative and data-driven field of study (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades), Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)).
In particular, ecologists have adopted many statistical paradigms (e.g., *Bayesian*, *AIC*, and *MCMC*) and genetic analytical techniques (e.g., *phylogenetics*, *Omics*, and *next generation sequencing*) over the past three decades, drawing from other disciplines such as computer science, engineering, and molecular biology.
The increased use of these terms highlights the importance of advanced training in statistics, genetic techniques, and computer programming.
In contrast, *natural history* has remained steadily in the lexicon for eight decades  (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)a), while the loss of natural history from ecological curricula is mourned and debated [@tewksbury2014; @able2016; @barrows2016].
From the perspective of preparing students to publish in the field, our results reinforce the call to refocus ecological statistical education from declining recipe-based approaches (e.g., *ANOVA*s) to probability theory, programming, and simulation-based approaches [@mcelreath2015].

Our approach expands upon prior culturonomic studies that focused on shorter periods of time [@mccallen2019] or smaller bodies of text [@kim2018; @mccallen2019] allowing us to put our results in a broader context. 
<!-- Our expanded corpus working with the full-text content of journals and using both algorithmic and hand-curated analyses of trends can put shorterm trends into a broader context. -->
For example, the term *conservation* was one of the fastest growing terms in the corpus (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)a), which contrasts with an earlier culturomic analysis [@mccallen2019].
McCallen et al. [@mccallen2019] found a slight decrease in the relative use of *conservation* in their analysis, while our full-text analysis revealed that *conservation* was one of the fastest growing terms in our corpus (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)e, Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)a).
This may be due to higher frequency of use of the term in the introduction or discussion sections of a manuscript, which appear in much-abbreviated forms in abstracts.
Similarly, McCallen et al. [@mccallen2019] found a significant decline in the use of *competition* over the past four decades.
Indeed, between 1970--2010, the frequency of *competition* mainly declined in our analysis, yet when analyzed over eight decades, we found that the underlying trend is multi-peaked with an overall positive slope (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)c).
<!-- Our corpus demonstrates that trends can be sensitive to the temporal scale considered. -->

There are a number of important caveats to keep in mind when interpreting our results.
First, our analysis tracks frequency of term use in the ecological literature but such frequency does not necessarily correspond to the importance of related concepts to the field.
For example, some terms may be frequently mentioned in paper introductions but appear less often as the core topic of research.
Other terms, such as *conservation*, are linked to journal titles such as "Conservation Biology" and appear in the bibliography section of some papers.
Second, the journals included in the corpus are not a random sample across the field of ecology.
Our corpus does not include some prominent journals that publish ecological research (e.g., "Science" and "Nature"), nor does it include taxonomic-specific journals such as the "American Journal of Botany" or "The Journal of Wildlife Management", which we intentionally excluded to reduce taxonomic bias (see Methods).
Third, the quality of the corpus improves through time---the data from the earlier years in our analysis are based on much smaller sample sizes than the more recent data (Fig. \@ref(fig:totals-by-journal), \@ref(fig:total-by-year)) and the data from the earlier years is mostly based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which is used to turn scanned PDFs into text with some inevitable errors.
Despite these unavoidable caveats, we see considerable merit in our full-text analysis of multiple ecological journals in terms of accomplishing a broad overview of the field and contributing to a growing body of knowledge through multiple lines of inference.

Our analyses allow ecologists to reflect on the past, present, and future of their field.
Within eight decades, the field has evolved from focusing on natural history and observational field studies to a multidisciplinary field that is more applied and quantitative in scope.
 <!-- and that supports a much wider diversity of practitioners -->
Undoubtedly, the fields of ecology and conservation have and will continue to adopt approaches developed elsewhere, such as analyses of increasingly large datasets and the use of deep learning [@christin2018], which will empower ecologists to answer questions that were previously unanswerable.
Yet, while quantitative and meta-analysis-style research---this paper included---are valuable [@osenberg1999], if ecology wishes to maintain its natural-history and fundamental-science roots, the field needs to prioritize such a focus through research funding bodies and educational curricula.
<!-- In addition, interdisciplinary work with social science is necessary to incorporate the human dimension into ecological research and develop conservation solutions. -->
As we see it, elements of ecology today are almost unrecognizable from the field 90 years ago; only time will tell if this rate of evolution will continue, leaving ecologists in 2100 with a similar sentiment.
<!-- TODO: Space for a wider diversity of ecologists now -->
<!-- Ecology today encompasses a much wider diversity of ecologists than in 1930.-->

<!-- TODO: make sure we include some more citations from nat ecol evol -->

# Methods

## Data

<!-- all: 295 -->

We worked with the JSTOR data team to extract n-gram data from the full text of their database for a set of journals relevant to ecology and conservation. To select a set of journals, we reviewed all journals from the "Ecology & Evolutionary Biology" and "Biological Sciences" subject groups to evaluate their suitability for the analysis. We eliminated journals from our corpus according to the following rules: (1) We removed all journals that were taxonomically specific (e.g., we did not retain "Annals of Botany") to reduce taxonomic bias in our corpus through time.
<!-- n = 62 -->
This step reduced the corpus from approximately one billion words to just over 0.5 billion words, although the patterns in the "hand-curated panels" (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)--\@ref(fig:social)) remained largely unchanged. (2) We removed all journals that were not in English.
<!-- n = 18 -->
We removed all journals that were not focussed on ecology or conservation (e.g., we removed journals that were purely biology focused).
<!-- n = 98 -->
(3) We removed journals that appeared in the JSTOR database for less than 10 years unless they were still in the database as of 2010 or continued under a different name. This was meant to focus on long-standing journals and reduce the influence of journals appearing and disappearing from the corpus and thereby influencing trends. (4) We removed journals that were region specific.
<!-- n = 24 -->
Specifically, we removed journals that were specific with respect to longitude but retained journals that were latitude specific (e.g., we retained "Arctic and Alpine Research" but not "Great Basin Naturalist Memoirs"). In total, our corpus included `r n_journals` journals or continuations of the same journal under different names (Table \@ref(tab:included-journals), Fig. \@ref(fig:totals-by-journal)). We focused on 1-, 2-, and 3-grams since most common terms we were interested in were three words or less and the computational burden increased substantially with longer n-grams.

```{r}
# Removed PNAS IDs:
pnas_excluded_pub_ids <-
  readRDS(here::here("data/generated/pnas_exluded_pub_ids.rds"))
```

Our initial analyses revealed a number of necessary data-cleaning steps prior to our final analysis. (1) Our initial corpus was dominated by data from Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), which also publishes a high volume of papers not relevant to ecology or conservation. Therefore, we excluded all papers (`r length(pnas_excluded_pub_ids)`) from PNAS that did not include one of the 1-grams "ecology" or "ecological". (2) We removed a series of terms from the typesetting system TeX that were inadvertently included from the American Naturalist (e.g., "amsmath" and "documentclass") (Table \@ref(tab:bad-amnat)). (3) We limited our analysis to 1930--2010. Before 1930, there was a considerably more limited set of journals included in the corpus, and after 2010, the number of journals in the JSTOR corpus and the total number of words began to decline as more recent volumes were not yet included in the dataset (Fig. \@ref(fig:total-by-year)). These issues led to presumably spurious trends before 1930 or after 2010.

<!-- Our approach underscores the value of data sets such as the JSTOR n-gram data in quantifying trends within a scientific discipline. Similar analyses are likely to become even more fruitful going forward with the increasing popularity of ecological pre-print libraries [REF] and open-access publication, including open-access data and programming [REF].  -->

bad_amnat <- readr::read_lines(here::here("data/bad-amnat.txt")) # latex code
bad_amnat <- tolower(sort(bad_amnat))
bad_amnat <- paste(bad_amnat, collapse = ", ")
```

## Algorithmic panels

We conducted a series of data processing steps to determine the most popular 1- and 2-grams in various time periods.
To speed computation, we began by filtering the full data set down to the top 7000 1- and 2-grams over each respective decade or time window.
We then removed all n-grams that included numbers, we removed all 1-grams that had three or fewer characters, and we removed 2-grams in which either the first or second had three or fewer characters.
To focus only on relevant parts of speech, we assigned parts of speech with the TreeTager probabilistic part-of-speech tagger [@schmid1994] via the R [@r2018] package koRpus [@korpus2018].
For 1-grams, we retained only nouns. For 2-grams, we retained only adjectives and nouns. Using the same TreeTager parsing, we aggregated all remaining n-grams by their lemmas.
For example, "plant" and "plants" are both derived from the same lemma "plant" and were combined.
At this stage, we retained the top 800 1- and 2-gram lemmas by the frequency over the entire time span.
We then excluded a set of n-grams that would primarily be used as affiliations or journal names or were frequent figures of speech unrelated to ecology (Tables \@ref(tab:exclusion-n-grams) and \@ref(tab:exclusion-n-grams-giants)).
After these filtering steps, we retained the top nine 1- and 2-grams in the time periods 1940--1949 and 2000--2009 for plotting in Fig. \@ref(fig:decades).
We then divided our eight decade time period into four time periods (1920--1959, 1960--1979, 1980--1999, 2000--2010) and pulled the top 144 1- and 2-grams for each (Figs \@ref(fig:giant-1-1920) to \@ref(fig:giant-2-2000)).
We chose longer time periods for the earlier years given the increasing sample sizes over time to maintain a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio.

Using the filtered dataset as described above with the top 800 1- and 2-grams, we determined the n-grams with the most rapid increases and decreases by fitting generalized linear models. We fit models of the form: $y_i \sim \mathrm{QuasiPoisson}(\mu_i),\ $ $\log(\mu_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathrm{year_i} + \log(\mathrm{total}_i)$, where $y_i$ refers to the number of occurrences of a given n-gram in year $i$, $\mu_i$ refers to the expected number of occurrences, the $\beta$ terms refer to estimated parameters, "year" refers to a respective year, and "$\mathrm{total}_i$", which acts as an offset term, refers to the total number of 1-grams in year $i$. The QuasiPoisson distribution, fit in R [@r2018], allows for over dispersion beyond the Poisson distribution (variance that scales faster than the mean). We sorted the n-grams by their $\beta_1$ coefficient values in the above model to determine the nine 1- and 2-grams with the most rapid increases and decreases from 1930--1960 and 1980--2010.

When presenting these and all subsequent timeseries, we fit Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with the R package mgcv [@wood2017] to characterize the general trends and uncertainty about those trends. We fit models of the form $y_i \sim \mathrm{QuasiPoisson}(\mu_i),\ $ $\log(\mu_i) = \beta_0 + s(\mathrm{year_i}) + \log(\mathrm{total}_i)$, where all symbols have the same meaning as in the previous paragraph and the term $s(\mathrm{year_i})$ represents a thin-plate regression spline [@wood2003] smoother over time.

We conducted our fill-in-the-blank analysis (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks), Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks-supp)) using a similar approach to the top-nine-terms-by-decade approach described above. In contrast, however, we worked with the entire 2-gram dataset. We retained only 2-grams in which the word filling in the blank was at least four characters long. We combined 2-grams if the "blank" words had the same lemma and omitted a number of 2-grams in which the "blank" word rendered a 2-gram that was not ecologically relevant (Table \@ref(tab:bad-blanks)). We also omitted "biological conservation", since it appeared disproportionally as a journal name. We retained the top eight terms according to the total number of occurrences throughout the eight-decade time period.

## Curated panels

In addition to the algorithmic analyses described above, we assembled "hand-curated" panels in which we used our knowledge of the field to explore groups of related terms in the corpus (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)--\@ref(fig:social)). We developed these term groups through brainstorming sessions and iterative consultation with other postdoctoral fellows and alumni of the David H. Smith Conservation Research Fellowship Program. In many cases, we combined multiple related n-grams under a single umbrella term in the figures. For example, *GLM* and *generalized linear model* (and their plural forms) all appear as *GLM* in Fig. \@ref(fig:methods) and *human health*, *child health*, *childrens health*, *human health*, and *womens health* all appear as *human health* in Fig. \@ref(fig:social). The subcomponents of these umbrella terms can be seen in Fig. \@ref(fig:community-all)--\@ref(fig:social-all).

(ref:totals-by-journal-cap) Total number of words per year by journal in the corpus. Journal names are given as JSTOR "slugs" (Table \@ref(tab:included-journals)) and journals are arranged by total number of words across all years. Note that a number of the JSTOR slugs represent the same journal through time (e.g., "procroyasocilon2", "procroyasocilon4", etc.). URLs for the various JSTOR slugs can be created by adding <https://www.jstor.org/journal/> before the slug. For example, <https://www.jstor.org/journal/ecology>.
